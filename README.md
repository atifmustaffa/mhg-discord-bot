# MHG Discord Bot
## About
> A special discord bot for MHG channel
## Notes
- This bot is solely made to be used in MHG channel. Thus, won't be accepting any pull request. - _#PepoSad_
- The only reason this is in public repo because we don't have enough resource and we rely on free deployment. - _Yes I broke_
- Please ignore any programming ethics/mistakes because this bot is built from time to time, sometimes as programming practice. - _Why? Because I lazy_
- If you find this useful, just wish us the best.
## Installation
You can add MHG to your server with this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=157730590492196864&scope=bot&permissions=8)! Alternatively, you can clone this repo and host the bot yourself.
```
git clone https://github.com/atifmustaffa/mhg-discord-bot.git
```
After cloning, run an
```
npm install
```
to snag all of the dependencies. Of course, you need node installed.

Then prepare an `.env` file that contains the following variables:
```
BOT_TOKEN=<discord bot token>
BOT_APP_ID=<discord app id>
REDDIT_ID=<reddit app id>
REDDIT_SECRET=<reddit secret>
```
I also strongly recommend `nodemon` and `dotenv-cli` from npm as it makes testing much easier.

## Config
- Bot prefix: `!`
- Check `config.json` for more such as admin, colors etc

## Features
Just check them out yourself, goodluck reading :D
